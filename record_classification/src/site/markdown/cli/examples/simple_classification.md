## Simple Classification of Records

This example aims to walk through the necessary steps to classify a basic collection of records.
In order to classify a set of records using `classli`, it is necessary to train the system first.

Before we start, let's create a new folder named *simple_classification_example*. 
This folder will contain all the input files we pass to `classli` and all the output files `classli` produces.

Assume we would like to classify animals into one of the following classes:

- amphibian
- insect
- bird
- fish
- mammal
- reptile

To do so, we first need a data set that contains a collection of animals that are already classified, called the training data set.
The training data set is made up of a CSV file containing three columns: id, animal and class.
Here is the content of the training data set:

    id,animal,class
    1,seal,mammal
    2,rabbit,mammal
    3,butterfly,insect
    4,salmon,fish
    5,cod,fish
    6,frog,amphibian
    7,robin,bird
    8,snake,reptile
    9,ant,insect
    10,moose,mammal

Store the training data set into the folder we created earlier, in a file named *training_data.csv*.

The next thing we need is a set of records that we intend to classify, called unseen data set.
The unseen data set is made uo of a CSV file containing two columns: id and animal.
Here is the content of the unseen data set:

    id,animal
    1,rabbit
    2,butterfly
    3,cod
    4,frog
    5,robin

Also store the unseen data set into the folder we created earlier, in a file named *unseen_data.csv*.

We now have all we need to get `classli` do the job. 

Fire up the command line interface of your operating system (Command Prompt in windows, Terminal in Mac OS X and Shell in Linux).
Change the current directory to the one we created earlier by typing `cd`, followed by a space, followed by the path to the directory.

Initialise a new classification process by typing the following and press enter:

    classli init

Set the classifier using the following command:

    classli set --classifier EXACT_MATCH

In this example we use the `EXACT_MATCH` classifier. The next step is to load the training data set by executing the following command:

    classli load --from training_data.csv gold_standard -h -d "," -t 1.0 

The command above loads the training data set into the classli system. The *-h* specifies that the first line in the data file corresponds to column labels, the *-d ","* specifies values are comma-separated,
and finally *-t 1.0* specifies that 100% of the data should be used for training the classifier.

The next step is to load the unseen data set:

    classli load --from unseen_data.csv unseen -h -d ","

Now that the training and unseen data sets are loaded, we can clean them using the default built-in set of cleaners:

    classli clean --cleaner COMBINED

All the needed data is now loaded and cleaned. We now can begin to train the classifier:

    classli train

And finally classify the unseen records:

    classli classify -o classified_data.csv

The above command stores the classified records into a file called *classified_data.csv*, containing the following:

    ID,DATA,ORIGINAL_DATA,CODE,CONFIDENCE,DETAIL
    1,rabbit,rabbit,mammal,1.0,
    2,butterfli,butterfly,insect,1.0,
    3,cod,cod,fish,1.0,
    4,frog,frog,amphibian,1.0,
    5,robin,robin,bird,1.0,


The *classified_data.csv* file contains five columns:

- *ID* -- the id of the unseen record that is classified,
- *DATA* -- the data that was actually used for classification (since the data may be changed by cleaning),
- *ORIGINAL_DATA* -- the data that was loaded as part of the unseen data set,
- *CODE* -- the classification of the record,
- *CONFIDENCE* -- the confidence of the classifier in the classification of each record, and
- *DETAILS* -- optional details about the internal configuration of the classifier.

Notice how the data for record *2* is changed from *butterfly* to *butterfli*. This is change occurs as part of the cleaning process.
