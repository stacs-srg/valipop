"1) The alphabetical order of the council areas has changed due to adoption of the preferred forms of reference to the Edinburgh and Western Isles council areas. Previous versions of this table used the forms 'Edinburgh, City of' and 'Eilean Siar'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2) The rates for the '15 to 19' and '40 to 44' age-groups are calculated by including, in the numerator, any births to mothers who were aged under 15 or were aged 45+, respectively. The denominators for those rates are just the total numbers of women aged 15-19 and 40-44 in the population of Scotland. These figures do not include any births for which the mother's age was not known.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
